# COMVersion2 

<p>This program reads into csv files using Scanner and generates a list of BLOCKSECTIONS which contains a list of STUDENTS (per block) which contains a list of COURSES (per student).</p>

<p>Additional feature (FROM COMVersion1):</p>
 - <b>Added Total Number of Units</b>: Computes the sum of units from enrolled courses that each student have.
 - <b>Added Total Number of Students</b>: Computes the sum of students included in specific BlockSections.   
    
<i><b>NOTE: </b>This project is a seatwork for my OOP course subject. I was given a class diagram, a sequence diagram and a sample output as guide to making this program.</i>
