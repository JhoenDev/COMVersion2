# COMVersion2 

<p>This program reads into csv files using Scanner and generates a list of BLOCKSECTIONS which contains a list of STUDENTS (per block) which contains a list of COURSES (per student).</p>

Additional feature (FROM COMVersion1):
- **Added Total Number of Units**: Computes the sum of units from enrolled courses that each student have.
- **Added Total Number of Students**: Computes the sum of students included in specific BlockSections.   

<i>**NOTE:** This project is a seatwork for my OOP course subject. I was given a class diagram, a sequence diagram and a sample output as guide to making this program.</i>
